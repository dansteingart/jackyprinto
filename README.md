# Jacky Printo

## Overview

This is a simple interface to a set of ender3 stages and the Ultimus V dispenser. It provides 

- A simple keyboard based control to position the syringe tip
- A basic set of interfaces to send
    - GCode directly to the ender3
    - Serial commands to the Ultimus V
- It also interfaces with uStreamer to display the syringe tip
- Finally, it exposes a basic API to allow for control via http class
    - And there‚Äôs simple python wrapper for these calls.

| Control/Display | What It Does | Keyboard Shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| move x/y | The step size to move in x/y with a step command |  |
| x- / x+ / y- / x+ | Step the stage in x/y by move x/y | ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üì |
| move z | the step size to move in z with a step command |  |
| z+ / z- | Step the stage in z by move z | w (up) s (down) |
| X/Y/Z | Current Position in X/Y/Z |  |
| B actual | Actual Bed Temperature (ÀöC) |  |
| B set | Confirmed Setpoint for Bed (ÀöC) |  |

### Dispenser Settings

| Control/Display | What It Does | Keyboard Shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Set Pressure | Set Pressure (PSI) |  |
| Set Dispense Time | Set dispense time in seconds with up to ms precision |  |
| Set Vacuum | Set Pressure (Torr) |  |
| Toggle Pressure | Fire the goop (fire ready needs to be checked) | g (only) |
| Any Command | Type the command on the line per the ‚Ä£ manu |  |

### Picture Settings

| Control/Display | What It Does | Keyboard Shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prefix | the prefix for the file name. X_Y_Z_Time is appended automatically (i.e. no overwrites are possible) |  |
| user | Your initials |  |
| üì∏ | Take a snap | c |
| Camera Controls | Camera Specific settings autogenerated. Futz with to improve image quality. Won‚Äôt focus an unfocussed image |  |

## Absolute Position

| Control/Display | What It Does | Keyboard Shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Absolute Position | Set X/Y/Z specifically. Hit go to move. Hit zero to set current position to zero. |  |

### Ender Settings

| Control/Display | What It Does | Keyboard Shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Send Command | Send Marlin GCodes Directly to Ender |  |

Example: Make a square layer by layer

```python
import libjackyprinto as ljp
from time import time,sleep
jp = ljp.jackyprinto()

start = time()
z_ret = 0
xytick = 2
jp.move(0,0,z_ret)
sleep(1)
jp.setPressure(2)
#get starting position
sign = 1
delay = .05
for z in range(20):
    for j in range(10):
        for i in range(10):
            jp.move(0,0,-z_ret)
            sleep(delay)
            sleep(delay)
            jp.togglePressure()
            sleep(delay)
            jp.move(0,0,z_ret)
            sleep(delay)
            jp.move(sign*xytick,0,0)
            sleep(delay)
        sleep(delay)
        sign = sign*-1
        jp.move(0,xytick,0)
    sleep(3)
    #jp.move(0,0,.04)
    jp.move(0,0,1,absolute=True)
    sign=1
    sleep(300)
    jp.move(0,0,0,absolute=True)
    sleep(3)
```
